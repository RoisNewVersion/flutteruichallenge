# flutteruichallenge

Hi, This is my personal repository to improve my coding UI skill. Feel free to look at it.

## Note

Every time I made an UI update, It is going to be inside lib `uixx` folder.

## Usage

If you want to see what UI looks like, just update in `main.dart` file.

```dart
return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,
      ),
      home: SimpleLogin(), // You should change this class to what ever you want (see the ui folder)
    );
```
Feel free to give any feedback!
